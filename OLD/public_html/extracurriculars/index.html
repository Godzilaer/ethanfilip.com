                    <h5>Grade 9</h5>
                    <p>DECA is a business club that includes countless different categories. In 9th grade, I chose the individual Entrepeneurship series.</p>

                    <p>Science Olympiad consists of multiple competitions that begin as regionals and progress to states and beyond. In 9th grade, I was part of the 3 freshmen that made it onto the A team.</p>

                    <p>Programming began as a hobby for me that I found fun and relaxing. While it has continued to be this, it has also expanded into a main interest of mine.</p>

                    <h3>Flight Simulation</h3>
                    <p>I have been very interested by planes for a long time. The way large hunks of metal can come together so specifically to create a flying being is astonisting to me. I began with the X-Plane flight simulator and spent many hours learning the real life procedures for airliners and flying their routes. Then, I began connecting to a global network called Vatsim. Here, I enhanced the realism by having access to a network of air traffic controllers who followed real life procedures to the T that I would have to speak to and coordinate with to complete a flight. At the start of 2025, I also took an interest for the Air Traffic Control side of things and began training on Vatsim to become a controller in the Boston airspace.</p>
